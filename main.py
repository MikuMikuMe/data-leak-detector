Creating a full-fledged data-leak-detector that is intelligent enough to monitor, detect, and alert data leaks from cloud storage services is a complex and broad task and would typically involve multiple components, including integration with cloud providers, machine learning models to detect anomalies or unauthorized access patterns, and a real-time alerting mechanism.

Below is a simplified version of such a project. This program outlines key components and provides a basic framework for how such a system might be structured. It emphasizes the architecture, key functions, and error handling but does not integrate with real cloud services or provide an actual machine learning model due to the scope and complexity of the task.

```python
import logging
from typing import List
import random

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        except Exception as e:

### Key Components:
1. **Logging:** Uses Python's built-in logging module to track operations and errors.
2. **Simulation of Cloud Access:** Simulates access records to emulate cloud storage interactions.
3. **Analysis and Detection:** Contains a basic function to detect suspicious activity. Replace this with actual anomaly detection using a machine learning model.
4. **Alert Mechanism:** Alerts when suspicious activities are detected.
5. **Error Handling:** Wraps most operations in try-except blocks to capture and log errors.

### Note:
- **Integration with Real Cloud Services:** This example does not include actual interactions with a cloud service API like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. You would need to integrate these using their respective SDKs.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a genuine model with proper data for learning suspicious and normal behavior patterns.
- **Security and Privacy:** Ensure that the access to logs and detection methods are secure and comply with privacy regulations.

This example outlines a highly simplified framework of what a real-world application might look like, focusing on architectural structure.
